# kenakata ( কেনাকাটা )

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

It is a Fullstack functionality based Single page website where users can perform some search filtering functionalities. This project will focus on implementing pagination, searching, categorization and sorting of products.

### Functionalities:
1. Setup and Basic Structure:
    - Set up a new MERN stack project (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). If you want you can use Mongoose or Typescript. You can’t use Next.js for the project.
    - Create and structure the relevant APIs to fetch product data from the database.
    - Insert dummy product data manually to the database or you can implement an api to insert product data. At least 40 product data is required in the database. 
2. Pagination:
    - Implement pagination in the backend server to load products efficiently.
    - Display page numbers along with navigation buttons (Next, Previous) on the front end.
3. Searching:
    - Implement a search feature that allows users to search for products based on the product name.
4. Categorization:
    - Categorize products into different categories, such as:
      - Brand Name
      - Category Name
      - Price Range
    - The users can filter products with a single filter option or they can use all the available options at the same time if they want. For example: Users can engage brand name, category name, and price range at the same time or they could select just one. 
5. Sorting:
    - Implement sorting functionality so users can sort products by:
      - Price: Low to High, High to Low
      - Date Added: Newest first
6. Authentication:
    - Implement Google Authentication using Firebase.
    - Implement Email and Password Authentication using Firebase.
7. UI Instructions:
    - Ensure the website is fully responsive with a mobile-first design approach.
    - Create fixed-size product cards to display product information concisely.
    - Include a Navbar with the website name/logo and relevant routes.
    - Implement a Footer with necessary information and links.
8. Additional Notes:
    - Ensure code is clean, well-commented, and follows best practices.
    - Add at least 10 meaning full commits on both frontend and backend repository
    - Include a README file in both the frontend and backend repositories, describing the project setup, instructions, and any necessary details for running the project locally.
